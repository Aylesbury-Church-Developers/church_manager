# church_manager

Church Manager is a concept David Richardson had in 2019 after seeing issues with members not fulfilling assigned roles during services.
It seemed that simple notifications before the service as a reminder could significantly improve the success ratio in people doing their assigned roles.

This is now a collaborative project being conducted (under guidance) by the Youth of Aylesbury Seventh-day Adventist Church.
