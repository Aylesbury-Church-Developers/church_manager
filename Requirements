Simple use case based list of requirements

1 The system will hold (and allow the maintenance of) a list of members, a list of services, a list of platform roles and an association between the three
  (An association between member, service and platform role essentially indicates who does what during which service)
2 Each service can be configured to have a minimum set list of roles - for example, Elder on duty, Main Deacon etc.  
  Eventually the system will advise if all necessary roles are not assigned
3 The system will automatically notify members of their role assignments in advance of the service.  This can all be configured for no, single or multiple reminders
4 After the service, the system will allow us to record if the member did participate.  This helps us generate a %ge reliability for members
5 The system will eventually assist with member assignment - perhaps automatically assigning them factoring in their %ge reliability
